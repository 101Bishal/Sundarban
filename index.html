<h1 id="one">Details of Sundarban</h1>
<p>The Sundarbans mangrove forest, one of the largest such forests in the world <b>(140,000 ha)</b>, 
    lies on the delta of the <i>Ganges</i>, <i>Brahmaputra</i> and <i>Meghna</i> rivers on the <pre>Bay of Bengal.</pre> 
    It is adjacent to the border of India's Sundarbans World Heritage site inscribed in 1987.</p>

    <h1>The histry of Sundarban</h1>
    <p>the history of human settlement in the Sundarbans area can be traced back to Mauryan era (4th-2nd century BCE).A ruin of an abandoned city was found in the Baghmara Forest Block that is attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chand_Sadagar" target="_blank">Chand Sadagar</a>, 
        a pre-Mauryan semi-historical figure in Bengali folklore. <sup>[16]</sup> Archaeological excavation at Kapilmuni,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paikgachha_Upazila" target="_blank">Paikgacha Upazill</a>,north of the Sundarbans in Bangladesh, revealed ruins of urban settlement dating back to the early middle ages.
        <sup>[17]</sup> During the Mughal period, forest tracts were leased out by the local rulers for establishing settlements.
        <sup>[16]</sup> In 1757, The British <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company" target="_blank">East India Company</a> obtained proprietary rights over Sundarbans from the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II and completed mapping the area in 1764.
        However, systematic forest management started a century later. <strong>the first Forest Management Division to have jurisdiction over the Sundarbans was established in 1869.</strong> 
        In 1875 a large portion of the mangrove forests was declared as reserved forests under the Indian Forest Act of 1865 (Act VIII of 1865).
        The remaining portions of the forests were declared a reserve forest the following year and the forest,
        which was so far administered by the civil administration district, was placed under the control of the Forest Department.
        A Forest Division, which is the basic forest management and administration unit, was created in 1879 with the headquarters in Khulna, Bangladesh.
        The first management plan was written for the period 1893-1898.<sup>[18][19]</sup></p>

        <h1>Geography</h1>
        <p>The Sundarban forest lies in the vast delta on the Bay of Bengal formed by the super- confluence of the Hooghly, Padma (both are distributaries of Ganges), Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers across southern <a href="Bangladesh.html" target="_blank">Bangladesh</a>
        The seasonally flooded Sundarbans freshwater swamp forest lies inland from the mangrove forests on the coastal fringe.h
        <mark>The forest covers 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> (3,900 sq mi) of which about 6,517 km<sup>2</sup> (2,516 sq mi) are in Bangladesh.</mark>
        The Indian part of Sundarbans is estimated to be about 3,483 km<Sup>2</Sup> (1,345 sq mi), of which about 1,700 km<sup>2</sup> (660 sq mi) is occupied by water bodies in the forms of river, canals and creeks of width varying from a few metres to several kilometres.
        The Sundarbans is intersected by a complex network of tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests. The interconnected network of waterways makes almost every corner of the forest accessible by boat.
        The area is known for the Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris), as well as numerous fauna including species of birds, chital, crocodiles and snakes. The fertile soils of the delta have been subject to intensive human use for centuries,
        and the ecoregion has been mostly converted to intensive agriculture, with few enclaves of forest remaining. The remaining forests, taken together with the Sundarbans mangroves, are important habitat for the endangered tiger.
        Additionally, the Mangroves species present in the Sundarban area serve a crucial function as a protective barrier for the millions of inhabitants in and around Khulna and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Mongla" target="_blank">Port of Mongla</a> against the floods that result from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone">cyclones</a>.
        It also protects from tsunami and soil erosion for the coastal population.</p>
        <h1>Mammals</h1>
        <p>The Sundarbans are an important habitat for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_tiger" target="_blank">Bengal tiger</a> (Panthera tigris). The forest also provides habitat for small wild cats such as the jungle cat (Felis chaus),
        fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus), and leopard cat (P. bengalensis).<sub>[43]</sub>Several predators dwell in the labyrinth of channels, branches, and roots that poke up into the air.
        This is the only mangrove ecoregion that harbors the Indo-Pacific region's largest terrestrial predator, the Bengal tiger. Unlike in other habitats, tigers live here and swim among the mangrove islands, where they hunt scarce prey such as the chital deer (Axis axis),
        Indian muntjacs (Muntiacus muntjak), wild boar (Sus scrofa), and Rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). <u>It is estimated that there are now 180 Bengal tigers<sub>[33]</sub> and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.</u>
        The tigers are known to attack and kill humans who venture into the forest, with around 40 deaths recorded in 2000â€“2010.<sub>[36]</sub></p>
